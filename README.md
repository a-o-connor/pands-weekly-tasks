## Introduction 
This git repository contains my work on 7 assignments carried out for the Programming and Scripting module I am taking as part of a course in Computer Science at ATU. The 7 weekly tasks are contained in 7 folders labelled task_week03-07. Details on these are provided in the contents section below. 

## Contents
1. The first folder contained in this repository is task_week02, containing the file bank.py, a Python program that prompts the user to enter two money amounts (in cent), adds the two amounts and prints out the answer in a human readable format. 
2. The second folder contained in this repository is task_week03, containing the file accounts.py, a Python program that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs)
3. The folder task_week04 contains the file collatz.py, a Python program that takes an integer input and uses a while loop with an if else statement to perform a Collatz sequence on the integer, continuing the sequence until the value is 1. 
4. The folder task_week05 contains the file weekday.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook written in Python. The program uses the ````isoweekday()```` function from Python ````datetime`` library and an if else statement to return whether or not today is a weekday.
5. The folder task_week06, containing a Jupyter notebook square_root.ipynb, written in Python. In it, a function is defined that uses Newton's square root finding algorithm to return the square root of a user input number. 
6. The folder task_week07 contains three files. The first is a Lorem Ipsum text file. The Jupyter notebook, week07_task.ipynb, contains a number of attempts to create a function that will read in a text file and output the number of e's it contains. The final function is meant to take the filename from an argument on the command line. Therefore, in order for the command line argument to be accepted, a python file ecounter.py was created.
7. The folder task_week08 contains a Jupyter notebook that plots histogram of a normal distribution and a line  plot of the function  $h(x)=x^3$ on the one set of axes. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html)  was used to generate a normal distribution of 1000 values with a mean of 5 and an SD of 2. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) was used to create the histogram and line plot.
